## 🛠 Technical Stack Decisions

### Backend Choice

- [ ] **Firebase** (Recommended for speed)
  - ✅ Quick setup and authentication
  - ✅ Real-time database capabilities
  - ✅ Built-in security rules
  - ❌ Vendor lock-in
- [ ] **Supabase** (Good alternative)

  - ✅ PostgreSQL database
  - ✅ Open source
  - ✅ Good TypeScript support
  - ❌ Smaller ecosystem

- [ ] **Custom Backend** (Node.js/Express)
  - ✅ Full control
  - ✅ Existing skills can transfer
  - ❌ More setup and maintenance

**Decision:** **\*\***\_\_\_**\*\*** (Date: **\_\_\_**)

### Database Schema Design

```sql
-- Users table
users (
  id, username, email, display_name,
  spotify_id, profile_image, bio,
  privacy_settings, created_at, updated_at
)

-- Friends/Relationships
friendships (
  id, user_id, friend_id, status,
  requested_at, accepted_at
)

-- Cached Music Data
user_music_cache (
  id, user_id, data_type, time_range,
  spotify_data, cached_at, expires_at
)

-- Share Links
share_links (
  id, user_id, link_id, data_type,
  privacy_level, created_at, expires_at
)
```
